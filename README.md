# book_object
A Python program written for a university lab test, which demonstrates OOP qualities including inheritance and operator overloading.

The program creates two classes (Publication and Book), where Book 
inherits attributes from Publication and builds upon them.

The book class also overloads the addition operator, allowing the user 
to add two book classes to eachother, which returns a new book object 
with a name the user specifies, and a combined price and page count.
This includes proper error checking. 

I achieved a score of 95% using this program.
